## Changes in Fork compared to original version
The original script uses obfuscated tracking and sends info to a 3rd party website. This is not disclosed anywhere in the readme. So I forked this project and removed any findings of that in order to have a much safer experience.

It uses an iframe to a Wikipedia site in order to circumvent Youtube Ads. However, I replaced the initial target page (was an inappropriate one) with the landing page of Chuck Norris and de-obfuscated that link.
